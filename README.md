1.0vs  
The goal of the game is to hit the exit gate. Each player hits from the tee box through the entry gate into the playing field.  
+2.0vs  
Add Flonks to Flonk. I mean the playing field is the Flonk and the next objects in Flonk are Flonks.  
So you can get the next points from Flonks hitting as "hit points".

1 = 1point, 4points = 1Quatro, 4quatro = WINNER  
+2.0vs Every Flonks hit = +1hit point  

If the opponent's entry is interfered with, all earned points are nullified, quattro remains, and the next player plays.  
If Flink stays inside the playing field and does not go outside, points are nullified and the next player plays.  

If there is interference with the 4 side openings, the current player plays again.

This is a prototype, original will be bigger and woodish playground and glass link, rubber lank.
